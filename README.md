**MERN Stack Developer | AI & Web App Enthusiast**

##  About Me  
I’m Ahsan, known on GitHub as [`@acroash1122`](https://github.com/acroash1122). I build web and AI-enabled applications that solve real problems.  
- Proficient with **React**, **Node.js**, **Express**, **MongoDB** and modern front-end tools.  
- Currently deep-diving into **AI / LLM-based systems**, agentic RAG pipelines, and cloud infrastructure.  
- Passionate about creating intuitive dashboards, and recently building a MERN stack Expense Tracker with AI-powered auto-categorization.  
- Motivated by continuous learning: from deep neural networks, operating systems, to full-stack architecture and system design.

##  Skills  
| Front-end | Back-end / DB | AI / Tools | DevOps & Others |
|-----------|--------------|------------|----------------|
| React, Redux, HTML5, CSS3, Tailwind | Node.js, Express, MongoDB, MySQL | Hugging Face Transformers, RAG systems, LLM integration | Git, Docker, CI/CD, Azure VM/AppService |

##  Featured Projects  
Here are some pinned projects you can check out:  
- **Expense Tracker** — MERN-stack web app with AI-driven transaction categorization.  
- **LLM_Fine_Tuning_Hackathon** — notebook-based exploration into large language model fine-tuning.  
- **GreenKyper Application** — Flutter Based application, monitors the driver perform and survillence.

##  Current Focus  
- Enhancing my AI-integration skills: agentic workflows, knowledge-retrieval via RAG, system design for production-ready AI services.  
- Improving frontend UX/UI with TailwindCSS while keeping React logic clean and modular.  
- Deepening backend architecture knowledge: microservices, scalable APIs, efficient data pipelines.  
- Documenting and sharing my learning journey: projects, blogs, open-source contributions.
- Determining the tetchnology of Flutter using Dart language.
